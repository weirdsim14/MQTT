# MQTT topics

In MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), a "topic" is a string identifier used to categorize and filter messages. Topics provide a way for publishers to specify the context or subject of their messages and for subscribers to indicate which messages they are interested in receiving.

Here are some key aspects of MQTT topics:

1. Hierarchical Structure: MQTT topics have a hierarchical structure, similar to a file path in a file system. They are organized using slashes (/). For example: home/livingroom/temperature.

2. Publisher: When a device or application (publisher) wants to send a message, it publishes the message to a specific topic.

3. Subscriber: Devices or applications (subscribers) indicate their interest in specific messages by subscribing to a particular topic or set of topics. They will then receive all messages published to those topics.

    Wildcard Subscriptions:
## Single level wildcards
        +: Represents a single level wildcard. For instance, home/+/temperature would match home/livingroom/temperature and home/kitchen/temperature, but not home/livingroom/sensors/temperature.

## Multiple level wildcards
        #: Represents a multi-level wildcard. If you subscribe to home/#, you'd receive messages from any topic that starts with home/, including home/livingroom/temperature, home/kitchen/humidity, and so on.

Topic Restrictions: MQTT topic names are case-sensitive, and they cannot contain the space character. They can be as long or as short as necessary, but they should be structured in a way that makes sense for the application's data and desired granularity.

Security: It's possible to implement security at the topic level, allowing, for instance, certain clients to publish or subscribe to some topics but not others.

Example:
Imagine a smart home system where multiple sensors are spread throughout the house. An MQTT broker manages messages from these sensors.

    The temperature sensor in the living room might publish its readings to the topic home/livingroom/temperature.
    A humidity sensor in the kitchen might publish to home/kitchen/humidity.
    An application or dashboard interested in temperatures from all rooms might subscribe to home/+/temperature.

This topic-based system allows for flexibility, as devices can dynamically publish or subscribe to topics based on their needs without requiring major system changes.
