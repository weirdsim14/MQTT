# MQTT topics

In MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), a "topic" is a string identifier used to categorize and filter messages. Topics provide a way for publishers to specify the context or subject of their messages and for subscribers to indicate which messages they are interested in receiving.

Here are some key aspects of MQTT topics:

1. Hierarchical Structure: MQTT topics have a hierarchical structure, similar to a file path in a file system. They are organized using slashes (/). For example: home/livingroom/temperature.

2. Publisher: When a device or application (publisher) wants to send a message, it publishes the message to a specific topic.

3. Subscriber: Devices or applications (subscribers) indicate their interest in specific messages by subscribing to a particular topic or set of topics. They will then receive all messages published to those topics.

    Wildcard Subscriptions:
## Single level wildcards
        +: Represents a single level wildcard. For instance, home/+/temperature would match home/livingroom/temperature and home/kitchen/temperature, but not home/livingroom/sensors/temperature.

## Multiple level wildcards
        #: Represents a multi-level wildcard. If you subscribe to home/#, you'd receive messages from any topic that starts with home/, including home/livingroom/temperature, home/kitchen/humidity, and so on.

Topic Restrictions: MQTT topic names are case-sensitive, and they cannot contain the space character. They can be as long or as short as necessary, but they should be structured in a way that makes sense for the application's data and desired granularity.

Security: It's possible to implement security at the topic level, allowing, for instance, certain clients to publish or subscribe to some topics but not others.

Example:
Imagine a smart home system where multiple sensors are spread throughout the house. An MQTT broker manages messages from these sensors.

    The temperature sensor in the living room might publish its readings to the topic home/livingroom/temperature.
    A humidity sensor in the kitchen might publish to home/kitchen/humidity.
    An application or dashboard interested in temperatures from all rooms might subscribe to home/+/temperature.

This topic-based system allows for flexibility, as devices can dynamically publish or subscribe to topics based on their needs without requiring major system changes.


# MQTT Clients

    Definition: An MQTT client is any device or software application that uses the MQTT protocol to either publish or subscribe to messages.

## Roles:

    Publisher: A client that sends messages (publishes) to a specific topic. For instance, a weather sensor could be an MQTT client that publishes temperature data to a topic like weather/temperature.

    Subscriber: A client that listens (subscribes) to specific topics to receive messages. A dashboard displaying the temperature from the above sensor would be a subscriber to the weather/temperature topic.

## Broker Interaction:
    MQTT clients interact with an MQTT broker, which is a server that receives all messages from publishers, processes them, and sends them to the appropriate subscribers.
    Clients connect to the broker using TCP/IP, though other transports like WebSockets can also be used.
    The broker can be located on a local network, cloud server, or any other accessible network point.

## Operations:

    Connect: Establish a connection to the MQTT broker. Clients may provide a unique client identifier during this process.

    Publish: Send a message to a specific topic.

    Subscribe: Express interest in one or more topics to receive relevant messages.

    Unsubscribe: Remove interest from specific topics.

    Ping: Keep the connection alive. Useful in scenarios where the client wants to ensure its connection to the broker remains active.

    Disconnect: Gracefully end the connection to the broker.

## Quality of Service (QoS):
 When publishing or subscribing to messages, clients can specify a QoS level (0, 1, or 2) that dictates the message delivery guarantee.

## Last Will and Testament (LWT):
 Clients can specify an LWT message when connecting. This message will be sent by the broker in case it detects that the client has unexpectedly disconnected.

## Retained Messages:
 Publishers can mark a message as "retained". This means the broker will store the message and deliver it to any future subscribers immediately upon their subscription to that topic.

## Practical Examples:

    Smart Home: In a smart home, various devices like lights, thermostats, and cameras can act as MQTT clients. A light switch might publish its status (on or off) to a topic, and a central home automation controller might subscribe to that topic to know the light's status.

    Industrial IoT: In a factory, machinery might publish operational data like vibration levels, temperatures, or operational status. A monitoring system could then subscribe to these topics to aggregate data and provide insights.

    Mobile Apps: A mobile app might use MQTT to subscribe to notifications or updates, ensuring real-time delivery with low overhead.

In essence, MQTT clients are the endpoints in the MQTT communication model, either producing data (publishers) or consuming it (subscribers), all orchestrated through an MQTT broker.
